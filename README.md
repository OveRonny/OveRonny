## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Ove Ronny**, and I'm a self-taught developer, primarily working with **C#** and **Blazor**.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently adding more features to my **ServiceApp**, which is in a public repository  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **JavaScript**  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I began my programming journey **after turning 40**â€”and I love proving itâ€™s never too late to learn!
